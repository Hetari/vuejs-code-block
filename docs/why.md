# Why Choose vuejs-code-block?

Building code blocks can be surprisingly complex, especially when you're aiming for more than just basic syntax highlighting. While there are many libraries available that handle syntax highlighting, the moment you require additional features—like **line numbers**, **line highlighting**, or **word-level customization**—things get tricky. 

If you're a technical writer or developer creating documentation or blog posts, these features are often essential. However, most syntax highlighting libraries fall short, either lacking these features entirely or making it difficult to customize or extend their functionality.

**vuejs-code-block** simplifies this process by focusing on the core functionality, leaving all styling and customization in your hands. Whether you need a basic code block or a highly customized one with advanced features, vuejs-code-block gives you the building blocks to achieve exactly what you want—without unnecessary bloat.

## How It Works

<!-- TODO: -->
<!-- **prismjs** -->
`vuejs-code-block` is built on top of the widely-used library for syntax highlighting. We've extended it by adding additional features such as:

1. **Line Numbers**: Toggle line numbers on or off.
2. **Custom Line Highlighting**: Highlight any specific lines with ease.
3. **Word-Level Customization**: Highlight individual words or phrases for emphasis or further explanation.

All of these features are exposed as **primitive Vue components**, giving you full flexibility to compose and style your code blocks however you want.


## Why Vue.js?

By offering **primitive components**, `vuejs-code-block` is incredibly flexible and allows for deep customization, unlike other libraries that come with rigid styling. As a Vue.js developer, you get to **compose** and **reuse** these components in a highly modular fashion, leveraging Vue’s reactive data and lifecycle methods for dynamic and performant code blocks.

## Final Thoughts

With `vuejs-code-block`, you're not just limited to out-of-the-box solutions—you’re empowered to create and style your code blocks exactly the way you envision. Whether you're building complex documentation, a technical blog, or educational material, this library lets you take full control of your code blocks without the headache of dealing with rigid styling or lack of customization.
